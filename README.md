## üìä Key Differentiators

### **vs. Traditional Compliance Tools**
| Feature | ComplianceNavigator | Traditional Tools |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Automation** | Fully autonomous multi-agent workflow | Manual research required |
| **Coverage** | Multi-country, multi-industry | Often single-jurisdiction |
| **Intelligence** | AI-powered gap analysis | Rule-based checklists |
| **Updates** | Real-time monitoring | Periodic manual updates |
| **Customization** | Startup-specific recommendations | Generic compliance guides |

### **True Agentic Benefits**

- **End-to-End Automation**: From initial query to actionable implementation plan
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing intelligence without manual intervention

## üîß Development & Customization

### **Adding New Regulatory Sources**
```python
# In agents/scout_agent.py
def add_regulatory_source(self, source_config):
    self.data_sources[source_config['name']] = {
        'base_url': source_config['url'],
        'api_key': source_config.get('api_key'),
        'search_endpoint': source_config['endpoint']
    }
```

### **Extending Agent Capabilities**
```python
# Create new agent in agents/
class CustomAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agent_name = "CustomAgent"
    
    async def process(self, input_data):
        # Custom processing logic
        return results

# Register in orchestrator.py
workflow.add_node("custom", self._custom_node)
```

### **Industry-Specific Modules**
The system can be extended with industry-specific compliance modules:
- `healthcare_module.py` - Medical device regulations, HIPAA
- `fintech_module.py` - Banking regulations, PCI DSS
- `crypto_module.py` - Cryptocurrency regulations, AML
